# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
## Project Overview
- Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes.
- Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots.
- Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population.
- Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. Write a summary interpretation of the findings.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
What metric or metrics are you going to test?

- The metrics to test should be the highway fuel efficiency, horse power, maintenance cost, or safety rating for consumers.

What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?

- The null hypothesis would be the mean of the safety rating equaling zero. The alternative hypothesis would be that the mean of the safety rating is not zero.

What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?

- For a statistical test, using a multiple linear regression statistical summary would show the variables impact on safety ratings for MechaCar vs. their competitors.

What data is needed to run the statistical test?

- Using a multiple linear regression statistical summary, we also need to collect the  highway fuel efficiency, safety ratings, and horsepower plus data.
